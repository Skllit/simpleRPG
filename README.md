This is a simple RPG game,created  using basics of javaScript and html and css in a FREECODECAMP course 
In this practice project, I have learnt fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript by coding  own Role Playing Game.
this game taught  how to work with arrays, strings, objects, functions, loops, if/else statements, and more.
